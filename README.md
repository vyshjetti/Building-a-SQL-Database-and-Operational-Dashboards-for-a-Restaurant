# Building-a-SQL-Database-and-Operational-Dashboards-for-a-Restaurant
This project focuses on developing a SQL database and creating dashboards to analyze key aspects of restaurant operations, including order activity, inventory management, and staff costs.

In this project, I took on the challenge of analyzing restaurant operations using SQL, from the ground up. I started by designing and building a relational database with interconnected tables (visualized and structured using QuickDBD).

My goal was to create insightful dashboards that could provide a clearer picture of the business. Using MySQL Workbench, I wrote a variety of custom SQL queries to power these dashboards, focusing on key areas:

•	Understanding Customer Orders: I analyzed order patterns, identified top-selling items, looked at sales trends over time, and even mapped out where orders were coming from and how they were being fulfilled (delivery vs. pickup).

•	Managing Inventory Effectively: I delved into ingredient usage based on the recipes of ordered items, calculated the cost of goods, and even started to track how much inventory was remaining.

•	Calculating Staff Costs: I also developed queries to calculate how much each staff member was earning for payment based on their hourly rate and the shifts they worked.

This project allowed me to demonstrate my skills in database design (using QuickDBD), writing complex SQL queries (in MySQL Workbench) to join data from multiple tables, and ultimately transforming raw data into meaningful insights for business decision-making.
